### Welcome to Day 1 Project to land your dream DevOps job

![Day-1](DevOpsDream-Day1/Day-1.png)

## Project Overview  
This project focuses on setting up a simple web server, such as Nginx or Apache, on a Elastic Compute cloud instances (EC2). Next, you'll create a Auto scaling Group (ASG) to simplify instances management and enable automatic scaling. To handle traffic and maintain high availability, you'll implement a Layer 7 Load Balancer in front of the ASG. Finally, you'll configure DNS to link a user-friendly domain name to the load balancer, making your web application accessible to users.

## Real-World Application  
Large e-commerce platforms like Amazon use similar setups to manage high traffic during events like holiday sales. By distributing incoming requests across multiple servers with a load balancer, they keep their websites fast and responsive while avoiding crashes. DNS mapping allows customers to easily reach the website using a recognizable domain name.

## Key Learning Outcomes  
By completing this project, you will:

1. **Learn Web Server Deployment Basics**: Understand how web servers function and how to configure them.  
2. **Explore Cloud Computing**: Work with Virtual Machines, load balancers, and DNS in a cloud environment like Google Cloud, AWS, or Azure.  
3. **Practice Networking**: Configure network settings for Virtual machines and load balancers.  
4. **Understand Scalability and High Availability**: Use auto scaling Groups and load balancing to scale and make your application resilient.

## Getting Started  

### 1. **Select a Cloud Provider**  
Choose a cloud platform such as Google Cloud Platform (GCP), Amazon Web Services (AWS), or Microsoft Azure, and create an account. Each provider offers a free tier to help you experiment:  
- **[GCP Free Tier](https://cloud.google.com/free)**  
- **[AWS Free Tier](https://aws.amazon.com/free/)**  
- **[Azure Free Tier](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/free/)**  

*Pro Tip*: AWS is beginner-friendly and a great choice for starting your DevOps or Cloud journey.

### 2. **Follow Tutorials for EC2 Setup**  
Each cloud provider offers step-by-step guides for creating and configuring Virtual Machines:  
- **[Getting started with Amazon EC2](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/EC2_GetStarted.html)**  

---

### 3. **Set Up a Web Server**  
Learn how to install and configure popular web servers:  
- **[Nginx Installation Guide](https://www.nginx.com/resources/wiki/start/topics/tutorials/install/)**  
- **[Apache Getting Started Guide](https://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.4/getting-started.html)**  

---

### 4. **Explore Load Balancing**  
Refer to your chosen cloud providerâ€™s load balancing documentation to set up traffic distribution:  
- **[AWS Elastic Load Balancing Documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/elasticloadbalancing/latest/userguide/what-is-load-balancing.html)**
